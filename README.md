# Real-time-Anomaly-Detection-in-Network-Traffic-for-Cybersecurity
### Project Overview
Anomaly detection in network traffic is crucial for identifying and mitigating cybersecurity threats in real-time. This project involves developing a machine learning model to detect unusual patterns in network traffic that could indicate potential security threats.

### Project Goals
##### Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather a dataset of network traffic, preprocess the data.
##### Feature Engineering: Create relevant features for the anomaly detection model.
##### Model Development: Build and train an anomaly detection model.
##### Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
##### Deployment: Develop a real-time monitoring system that detects and alerts on anomalies in network traffic.

### Steps for Implementation
#### 1. Data Collection
    Use publicly available datasets such as:

      KDD Cup 1999: Intrusion detection dataset.
      NSL-KDD: An improved version of the KDD Cup 1999 dataset.
      UNSW-NB15: A modern dataset for network intrusion detection.
#### 2. Data Preprocessing
    Normalization: Normalize numerical features.
    Encoding: Encode categorical features.
    Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets.
#### 3. Feature Engineering
Create new features based on domain knowledge (e.g., packet size, duration, etc.).

#### 4. Model Development
Develop an anomaly detection model using an unsupervised learning approach (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders).

#### 5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

#### 6. Deployment
Deploy the model using Flask for the backend and a simple HTML/CSS frontend for real-time monitoring.
